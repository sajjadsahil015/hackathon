## The Robotic Nervous System

Just as a biological nervous system transmits signals between the brain and muscles, **ROS 2 (Robot Operating System)** acts as the middleware for robots. It allows different hardware components (Lidar, Motors, Cameras) to communicate with software algorithms (SLAM, Planning, Vision).

### Key Concepts

*   **Nodes**: Individual executable processes (e.g., `camera_driver`, `wheel_controller`).
*   **Topics**: Streaming data pipes (Pub/Sub).
*   **Services**: Request/Reply synchronous communication.
*   **Actions**: Long-running goals with feedback.
