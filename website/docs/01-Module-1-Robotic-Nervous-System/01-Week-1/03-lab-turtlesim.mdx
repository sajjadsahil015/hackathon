# Lab: Running Turtlesim

Turtlesim is the "Hello World" of ROS.

## Step 1: Start the Simulation

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
ros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node
```

You should see a blue window with a turtle.

## Step 2: Control the Turtle

Open a **new terminal** and run:

```bash
ros2 run turtlesim turtle_teleop_key
```

Use your arrow keys to drive the turtle.

## Step 3: Analyze the Graph

See how the nodes connect:

```bash
rqt_graph
```
