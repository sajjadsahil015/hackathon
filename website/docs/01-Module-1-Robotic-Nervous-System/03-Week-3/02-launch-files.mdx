# Launch Files

Starting 10 nodes manually is tedious. Launch files script this.

## Python Launch File

```python
from launch import LaunchDescription
from launch_ros.actions import Node

def generate_launch_description():
    return LaunchDescription([
        Node(
            package='turtlesim',
            executable='turtlesim_node',
            name='sim'
        ),
    ])
```

## Usage

```bash
ros2 launch my_package my_launch_file.launch.py
```
