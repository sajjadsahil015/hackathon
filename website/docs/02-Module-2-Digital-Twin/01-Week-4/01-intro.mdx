# Simulation Theory

## Why Simulate?

Building robots is expensive and slow. Simulators allow us to:
1.  **Iterate Fast**: Crash a virtual robot 1000 times for free.
2.  **Train AI**: Generate synthetic data for ML models.
3.  **Verify**: Test code before deploying to hardware.

## The Simulator Landscape

| Simulator | Best For | Engine |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| **Gazebo** | Physics & Sensors | OGRE/Physics |
| **Unity** | Rendering & VR | Game Engine |
| **Isaac Sim** | AI Training | Omniverse |
