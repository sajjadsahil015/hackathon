# Unity Robotics

## Why Unity?
Gazebo is great for physics, but Unity offers **Game-Engine quality graphics**. This is crucial for Computer Vision tasks where lighting and texture matter.

## ROS-TCP-Endpoint
Unity communicates with ROS 2 via TCP.
- **Unity**: Acts as the TCP Client.
- **ROS 2**: Acts as the TCP Server.
