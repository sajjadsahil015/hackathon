# Behavior Trees (BT)

## FSM vs BT
*   **Finite State Machines (FSM)**: Good for simple sequence. Hard to scale.
*   **Behavior Trees (BT)**: Modular, hierarchical, reactive.

## BT Nodes
*   **Control Nodes**:
    *   **Sequence (->)**: Run children in order. Fail if one fails.
    *   **Fallback (?)**: Run children in order. Success if one succeeds.
*   **Action Nodes**: Do work (Move, Speak).
*   **Condition Nodes**: Check state (IsBatteryLow?).
