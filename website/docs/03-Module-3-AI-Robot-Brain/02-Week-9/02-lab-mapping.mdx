# Lab: Mapping with RTAB-Map

## Setup
We will use **RTAB-Map** (Real-Time Appearance-Based Mapping).

## Launching
```bash
ros2 launch rtabmap_ros rtabmap.launch.py \
    rtabmap_args:="--delete_db_on_start" \
    depth_topic:=/camera/depth/image_raw \
    rgb_topic:=/camera/color/image_raw \
    camera_info_topic:=/camera/color/camera_info
```

## Driving
Drive the robot around the simulated room. Open RViz. You should see a colored 3D point cloud appearing.

```
