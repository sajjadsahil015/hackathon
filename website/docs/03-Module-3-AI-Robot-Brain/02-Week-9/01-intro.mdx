# Visual SLAM (vSLAM)

## The Problem
1. To map the room, I need to know where I am.
2. To know where I am, I need a map of the room.

## The Solution: SLAM
Using probability to estimate both simultaneously.

## Visual SLAM
Using cameras (RGB-D or Stereo) instead of Lasers.
*   **Features**: Edges, corners, blobs.
*   **Loop Closure**: "I have seen this chair before!" -> Corrects drift.
